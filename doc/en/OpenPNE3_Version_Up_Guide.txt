Update is the following way:

(1) Setting files
(2) Update the configuration file
(3) Execute the updating command

Update process
--------------

Setting Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the OpenPNE 3.8 files to your web server.

Avoiding problems with mixing the old and new files, you have to change all of the files instead of overwriting.

Update the Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy config files in OpenPNE 3.8 as follows:

::

  $ cd /path/to/new/OpenPNE3
  $ cp config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php.sample config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php
  $ cp config/OpenPNE.yml.sample config/OpenPNE.yml

NOTE: If you write your original configuration to your old config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php, you should change the new file referring to the old one.

And copy the old config/database.yml to new config/database.yml. Then you should change the config values in the OpenPNE.yml as your environment. Make sure you set "base_url" and "mail_domain", because they are used for posting and delivering mail.

::

  $ cp /path/to/old/OpenPNE3/config/databases.yml /path/to/new/OpenPNE3/config/databases.yml
  
Copy the Plugin Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy the old directory plugins to new one, so that to use the plugins which you install or newer version than bundled.

::

Case of the system like CentOS or Ubuntu which has '-u' option

  $ cp -au /path/to/old/OpenPNE3/plugins/. /path/to/new/OpenPNE3/plugins

Case of the system like MacOSX or FreeBSD which doesn't have '-u' but has '-n' option

  $ cp -an /path/to/old/OpenPNE3/plugins/. /path/to/new/OpenPNE3/plugins

NOTE: check your system using 'man cp' to execute above commands.

Re-build Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the project root directory, execute:

::

  $ ./symfony doctrine:build-model
  $ ./symfony cc
  
The next "Execute the Updating Command" requires these processes.

Execute the Updating Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the project root directory, execute:

::

  $ ./symfony openpne:migrate
  $ ./symfony plugin:publish-assets

This command will update OpenPNE and plugins to newer version.

You have to execute the following command if your using version is earlier than or equal to OpenPNE 3.2.7.2, OpenPNE 3.4.9 or OpenPNE 3.6beta6.

Please check the following blog post before performing the command.
