Setup
=====

Downloading OpenPNE 3
---------------------

Download a package of OpenPNE 3 from the following URL.

http://www.openpne.jp/pne-downloads/

Setting Files
-------------

Set the files to be the following structure:

::

  ./
  +-- LICENSE
  +-- NOTICE
  +-- apps/
  +-- cache/
  +-- config/
  +-- data/
  +-- doc/
  +-- lib/
  +-- log/
  +-- plugins/
  +-- symfony
  +-- test/
  
  (You can access the following directories from web browser)
  +-- web/ (This directory name can be changed)
      +-- index.php
      +-- js/
      +-- mobile_frontend.php
      +-- pc_backend.php
        :

Copying Config Files
--------------------

Copy config files as follows

::

  $ cd OpenPNE3
  $ cp config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php.sample config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php
  $ cp config/OpenPNE.yml.sample config/OpenPNE.yml
  
Then you should change the config values in OpenPNE.yml as your environment. Make sure you set "base_url" and "mail_domain", because they are used for posting and delivering mail.

Install Command Execution
-------------------------

Execute the following command to begin installing process.

::

  $ ./symfony openpne:install
  
This command deletes the database and rebuild it. 
If you don't want to delete your specified database -- for example, OpenPNE will share the database with other systems, execute that command with the following option.

::

  $ ./symfony openpne:install --non-recreate-db
  
This option attempts to remove the old tables in proper order by considering the new one.
It is strongly recommended to set prefixes with the tables used by OpenPNE in "OpenPNE.yml" for avoiding deleting tables of other system unexpectedly or failing deleting tables.

NOTE: Take care with their prefixes that avoid conflicting table names shared with the other system. And they are not for installing multiple OpenPNEs per identical database.

::

  table_prefix: "op_"
  
After Running "openpne:install", you will be required inputting the following:

* The DBMS (mysql, pgsql or sqlite, but we are now only support mysql)
* The Database Name
* The Database Username
* The Database Password(optional)
* The Database Hostname(localhost, etc)
* The Database Port Number(optional)
* (If you inputted "MySQL" for the DBMS and "localhost" for the hostname)The Database Socket Path(optional)

After that OpenPNE automatically is installed.

Delete the Development Files
----------------------------

::

  $ ./symfony project:clear-controllers

mod_rewrite Configuration

::

  RewriteBase / # Or /web
