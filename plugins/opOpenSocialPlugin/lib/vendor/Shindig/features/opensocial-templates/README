# Running Tests

You need to download JsUnit from http://jsunit.net/ and unzip to this folder,
or create a symlink 'jsunit' to your local jsunit directory.
Then you can run the tests for OpenSocial Template library by running the
following script in a unix-like environment:

firefox jsunit/testRunner.html?testpage=$PWD/ost_test.html

TODO: Instructions for loading test page for other operating system/browser
environments.

N.B.: Has been verified only on FF1.5 and FF2.

N.B.: These tests run in the jsunit.net version JsUnit, other than the
jsunit.berlios.de version used in the tests for other features. The heavy use of
client-side objects requires a browser-based JsUnit. This rules out the other
version, which uses an embedded Rhino engine. jsnuit.net does not support Maven,
so we cannot integrate the testing into Maven build process.
